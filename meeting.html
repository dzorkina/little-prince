    <p>
      In the beginning of his journey, the narrator—an aviator—crash lands in the Sahara Desert. It is there, among the endless sands and silent sky, that he meets the Little Prince for the first time. The boy appears mysteriously, asking the aviator to draw him a sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple request sparks a magical connection between the two. Through quiet conversations, the Little Prince slowly begins to reveal stories of his travels, his planet, and his rose. This first meeting is the gentle start of a friendship rooted in wonder, curiosity, and childhood truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aviator is taken aback—not only by the odd request, but by the Little Prince’s sincerity and quiet persistence. In a world that had taught the aviator to abandon his drawings and dreams, the Little Prince rekindles a sense of childlike imagination. He reminds the narrator, and us, that grown-ups often forget what truly matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desert, vast and empty, becomes the perfect stage for something meaningful to bloom: a bond built on vulnerability and listening. Their shared time under the stars begins not with big questions, but with a drawing of a sheep—and an unspoken understanding that something important is about to unfold.
