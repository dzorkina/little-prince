    <p>
      After visiting many strange planets, the Little Prince arrives on Earth—an enormous world compared to his own. He is astonished by its size and the silence of the desert where he lands. He soon meets a mysterious snake who speaks in riddles and claims to have great power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince asks where the people are, but Earth seems empty. He wanders through the sand and eventually meets a simple desert flower. She tells him that humans are scarce and often hard to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Little Prince finds a garden full of roses, he is devastated. He thought his rose was unique, but now sees thousands just like her. This realization shatters him—was his rose not so special after all?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earth begins to teach him difficult lessons about love, uniqueness, and sorrow. But this painful moment is the turning point that prepares his heart for something even more important: the fox.
