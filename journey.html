    <p>
      Leaving his rose behind, the Little Prince sets off on a journey to explore the universe. He visits a series of tiny planets, each inhabited by a strange grown-up. These encounters are humorous, puzzling, and sometimes sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he meets a King who rules over everything but has no one to govern. Then a Vain Man, who craves applause. A Drunkard who drinks to forget his shame. A Businessman counting stars as if they’re his possessions. A Lamplighter, endlessly lighting and extinguishing a lamp without rest. And a Geographer who records knowledge, but never explores himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each grown-up is trapped in their own habits, obsessions, or pride. The Little Prince is bewildered by how seriously adults take unimportant things. Their worlds are small not in size, but in spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through these meetings, the Prince begins to realize that what adults call “important” often misses the heart of life. His longing for something more — something sincere, tender, and true — grows stronger with every step.
