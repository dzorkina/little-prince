    <p>
      After parting from the Fox, the Little Prince continues his journey. In his search for meaning, he meets a railway switchman who explains how adults endlessly rush from place to place — yet rarely know what they’re looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then encounters a merchant who sells pills that quench thirst, claiming they save time. The Prince is puzzled: why save time, if one does not know what to do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      These moments reveal the absurdity of modern life, where convenience often replaces real experience. The Prince begins to understand that meaning isn't something found in haste or technology, but in moments of stillness, wonder, and care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, the Prince and the narrator — the pilot — grow close as they search for a well in the desert. When they find it, it’s not just water they receive, but something spiritual: a gift of renewal, hope, and quiet joy. The desert has shown them that what is essential is not always visible.
